MAP helps a software project explain itself to people and AI coding agents. You keep
the durable knowledge in one `.map/` directory. The CLI can analyze the project,
recommend missing production patterns, control the context budget, and generate the
native instruction files used by different assistants.

> **Current distribution:** MAP is installed directly from this GitHub repository.
> The npm package is not published yet, so do not use `npm install
> @missing-ai-patterns/cli`.

## Why MAP?

AI projects quickly scatter important knowledge across prompts, chat histories,
vendor configuration, diagrams, and developer notes. That makes agents repeat old
mistakes and makes architectural decisions difficult to review.

MAP gives that knowledge a stable home:

- **one source of truth** for every supported coding assistant;
- **reusable patterns** with trade-offs, implementation prompts, and acceptance tests;
- **AI-aware ADRs and schemas** readable by people and machines;
- **token-budget control** that exposes oversized and duplicated context;
- **Git-native collaboration** with deterministic, reviewable changes and offline operation.

## Install from GitHub

Requirements: Git, Node.js 20 or newer, and either `pnpm` or `corepack`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajanbor/map.git
cd map
./scripts/install.sh
map --version
```

The installer builds the CLI from this checkout and creates a `map` symlink in
`~/.local/bin`. It never overwrites an unrelated executable. To choose another
location:

```bash
MAP_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/bin" ./scripts/install.sh
```

If that directory is not in `PATH`, the installer prints the exact line to add to
your shell configuration. To update MAP later:

```bash
cd map
git pull --ff-only
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Start an AI project

```bash
cd your-project
map init
map analyze
map recommend
map optimize --save
map sync
```

`map init` detects the project and creates a versioned workspace without overwriting
existing files:

```text
.map/
├── map.config.json     project, analyzers, targets, and tool settings
├── architecture/      system boundaries, data flows, and diagrams
├── decisions/         AI architecture decision records
├── patterns/          patterns adopted with `map add`
├── prompts/           reusable product and engineering prompts
├── agents/            agent roles, permissions, and guardrails
├── evals/             datasets, rubrics, metrics, and quality gates
├── tools/             tool contracts and context budgets
├── reports/           generated analysis reports; ignored by Git
└── cache/             local registry cache; ignored by Git
```

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `map init` | Creates the `.map/` workspace and detects the project shape. |
| `map analyze` | Finds AI-related dependencies and architecture signals. |
| `map recommend` | Suggests missing patterns with evidence and priority. |
| `map patterns [query]` | Searches the local pattern catalog. |
| `map add <pattern-id>` | Adds a pattern prompt, metadata, and acceptance criteria. |
| `map optimize --check` | Measures context and enforces the configured token budget. |
| `map sync` | Generates instructions for supported AI coding assistants. |
| `map doctor` | Checks the workspace, registry, compiler, and references. |

## What is inside this repository?

| Area | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`library/`](library/) | AI engineering patterns, schemas, specifications, examples, and small reference implementations. |
| [`tooling/`](tooling/) | The TypeScript CLI, context compiler, analyzers, recommender, and shared packages. |
| [`apps/website/`](apps/website/) | The public, registry-driven pattern browser. |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | Getting started, project structure, and product documentation. |
| [`.map/`](.map/) | MAP's own workspace. The project uses the same structure it generates. |

The pattern library is framework-agnostic. Each published pattern explains when to
use it, when not to use it, its failure modes, trade-offs, an implementation prompt,
and verifiable acceptance criteria.
