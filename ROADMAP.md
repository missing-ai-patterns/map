# MAP Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the patterns MAP intends to document. It is a **living backlog** —
suggestions are welcome via the "New Pattern" issue template, and the ordering will
shift as the community weighs in.

**Legend:** ⬜ Planned · 🟡 In progress · ✅ Published

> Nothing here is published yet. This is the target catalog (~75 patterns) that
> defines MAP's initial scope. Claim one by opening a "New Pattern" issue.

## Delivery phases

MAP grows in phases so the highest-leverage patterns land first and conventions
solidify before the catalog scales.

- **Phase 0 — Foundations (current):** repository, template, contributor experience,
  style guide, reference-implementation conventions.
- **Phase 1 — Cornerstones:** the single most-referenced pattern in each category, to
  validate the template end-to-end (e.g. Chunking, Conversation Memory, Tool Calling,
  Prompt Injection, LLM-as-Judge, Streaming, Model Routing, Tracing).
- **Phase 2 — Depth:** fill out each category with the common production patterns.
- **Phase 3 — Frontier & composition:** advanced patterns, cross-category decision
  guides ("RAG vs fine-tuning"), benchmarks, and the interactive website.

## Cross-category decision guides (Phase 3)

Not patterns themselves, but decision-oriented articles that link patterns together:

- ⬜ RAG vs Fine-Tuning vs Long-Context
- ⬜ When to add Memory (and which kind)
- ⬜ Single Agent vs Multi-Agent
- ⬜ Caching decision guide (prompt / response / semantic)
- ⬜ Choosing a retrieval strategy

## Candidate categories (future)

Under consideration as the catalog matures — open a Discussion to shape these:

- **Reasoning** (chain-of-thought, self-consistency, decomposition)
- **Deployment** (canary rollouts, model versioning, shadow traffic)
- **Data & Ingestion** (parsing, embedding pipelines, freshness)
- **Fine-Tuning & Adaptation** (LoRA, distillation, preference tuning)
- **Multimodal** (image/audio retrieval and grounding)
